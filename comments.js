// Create web server
// Create a web server that listens to port 3000 and serves the comments.json file.
// The comments.json file will be sent to the client when the client sends a GET request to the server.
// The comments.json file should be read from the disk and sent to the client with the correct content type.
// The server should handle errors when the file is not found.
